# Assignments
1. Create a class called *Animal* with at least 4 fields and a simple method to display animal details. Create an object of *Animal* class in entry point, assign all fields and call a method displaying animal details.

    1. Method to calculate product of squares of two supplied numbers.
    1. Method to calculate cuberoot of a number.
    1. Method to calculate BMI index of a person.

1. Think of a real-world example where you have 4 classes as folowing:
    1. **Class1**: has at least two fields and a overridable method
    2. **Class2**: inherits from class1, has at least a extra field
    1. **Class3**: inherits from class1, should override a method in its parent
    1. **Interface1**: has at least two method definitions
    1. **Class4**: inherits class 2 and implements interface1

1. Write a real world class that contains:
    1. three properties: full, read-only and write-only
    1. a static method
    1. put this class with in a namespace
    1. Instantiate (create object) this class in entry point (Main method)
